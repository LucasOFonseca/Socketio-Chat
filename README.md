## Description

This project is a simple chat developed using Node.js and Socket.io to demonstrate the use of these technologies to create real-time applications based on WebSocket communication.

## Features

- Shows a notification when a new user joins the chat and when someone leaves too;
- Highlight messages sent by the user;
- Gives a unique color to each username in its messages (for the first ten only);
- Groups messages when the same user sends more than one in a row.
